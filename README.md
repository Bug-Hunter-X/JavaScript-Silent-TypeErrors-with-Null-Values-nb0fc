This repository demonstrates a subtle JavaScript error that can occur when adding variables of different types.  The bug is silent when one of the variables is null, but throws a TypeError if one variable is a string.  The solution involves robust type checking before performing addition.  This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in JavaScript to prevent unexpected runtime errors.
